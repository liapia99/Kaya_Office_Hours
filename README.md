# Kaya_Office_Hours

So for this mini project Prof. Kaya wanted to be able to display messages in his office. If he was sick, changed his office hours or just wanted to write a nice message for anyone passing by, this LED panel display his message. 


One of the biggest hurdles was figuring out how to remotely access the display. I did not want to do anything too difficult so that in the future if Prof. Kaya decided to change his host site or the colors of the display, he could do so with ease. 

This is what the site looks like:
